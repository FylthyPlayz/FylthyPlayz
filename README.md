- 👋 Hi, I’m Jacob Cook and I'm a newer programmer/developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things code but I love reading, D&D and playing video games. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, NodeJs, TypeScript, SQL and how to use GitHub to it's fullest potential. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can help me learn these things. 
- 📫 How to reach me. You can email me at jacob_cook_football@yahoo.com.
